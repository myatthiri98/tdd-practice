# Day 26 - Problem 26: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem Description

You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

[3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
Notice that rotating the array 4 times moves the last four elements of the array to the beginning. Rotating the array 6 times produces the original array.

Assuming all elements in the rotated sorted array nums are unique, return the minimum element of this array.

A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?
