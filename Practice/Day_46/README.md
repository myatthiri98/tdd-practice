Maximum length of consecutive 1s or 0s after flipping at most K characters

Given a binary string S of size N and an integer K, the task is to find the maximum length of consecutive 1s or 0s after flipping at most K characters of the given binary string S.

Examples:

Input: S = “1001”, K = 1
Output: 3
Explanation:
Flip the K(= 1) characters at index 3 of the string modifies the string S to “1000”. Now the maximum length of consecutive 0s is 3, which is the required result.

Input: S = “11011011”, K = 3
Output: 8
