# Day 17 - Problem 17: Minimum Stack

## Problem Description

Design a stack class that supports the push, pop, top, and getMin operations.

MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

Constraints:

-2^31 <= val <= 2^31 - 1.
pop, top and getMin will always be called on non-empty stacks.
